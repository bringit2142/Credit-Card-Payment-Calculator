# Credit-Card-Payment-Calculator
A program that calculates how many payments are needed to pay off a credit card


Your program is designed to run from the terminal. To run it, open a terminal and ensure you are
in the directory where your script is saved.
The  program  takes  three  required  command-line  arguments:  a  balance  amount,  an  APR  integer
(expressed  as  a  number  between  0  and  100)  and  a  credit  line  amount  (expressed  as  a  positive
integer). It also allows the following optional arguments: --payment (the desired monthly payment)
and --fees (the amount of monthly fees that the credit card requires). Below are some examples of
how  to  use  the  program.
